              <p>Prigi Beach is a beach on the southern coast located along the edge of the Indian Ocean,
                administratively part of Tasimadu Village, Watulimo District, Trenggalek Regency, East Java, Indonesia.
                It is about 48 km from the center of Trenggalek.</p>
              <p>In addition to being a popular tourist attraction, Prigi Beach is also a national port, where it serves
                as one of the largest fishing ports on the southern coast of Java Island.</p>
              <p>Visitors to this beach can enjoy activities such as fishing, camping, playing tennis, or simply staying
                at one of the nearby hotels to enjoy the beautiful scenery.</p>
              <p>Prigi Beach becomes livelier during the month of Selo in the Javanese calendar, as local fishermen hold
                the traditional Larung Sembonyo ceremony — an annual ritual to give thanks to God for abundant sea
                harvests. Besides being a thanksgiving ceremony, locals also believe that Larung Sembonyo is held to
                commemorate a historical wedding of Raden Tumenggung Yudha Negara, a military leader of the Mataram
                Kingdom who opened the Prigi region with the promise to marry Princess Gambar Inten.</p>

                northwest of the beach, there is a waterfall with a height of 25 meters. This waterfall can be used for
                bathing and is believed by locals to help maintain youthfulness. In addition, about 100 meters east of
                Pelang Beach, there is Pelang Cave with a depth of approximately 500 meters. Pelang Cave is still
                completely natural and has potential for further development.</p>
              <p>To enjoy the beautiful panorama of the sea and Pelang Beach, visitors can climb to the hilltop near the

              <p>Gua Lowo (in Indonesian: "bat cave") is a natural tourist attraction located in Trenggalek Regency,
                East Java. Gua Lowo is the longest cave in Southeast Asia, located in Watulimo District, Trenggalek
                Regency, with a total length of approximately 2 km. However, only 850 meters of it can be enjoyed by
                visitors because the remaining 1,150 meters currently have no access and are blocked by a strong river
                flow. Gua Lowo is about 27 km from the center of Trenggalek and Tulungagung.</p>

              <p><strong>History</strong><br>
                This cave was discovered in 1931 by a local resident named Lomedjo. When it was first found, the cave
                was covered by bushes and surrounded by dense forest. The name "Gua Lowo" or "bat cave" comes from the
                fact that the cave has long been inhabited by bats, which are called "lowo" in Javanese. Even today, a
                distinct bat odor can still be detected in several parts of the cave. Although discovered in 1931, the
                Trenggalek government only planned to develop Gua Lowo as a tourist site in 1983. During the planning
                stage, the government invited geology experts from Bogor and France, named Gilbert Manthovani and Dr.
                Robert K. Kho. Their exploration revealed that Gua Lowo was 2 km long and contained very large chambers.
                After this research, in 1984 Gua Lowo was officially opened as a public tourist attraction. According to
                Suparlan, Head of Tourism and Culture Promotion at the Trenggalek Youth and Sports Office, research by
                the French cave experts Gilbert Mantovani and Kingston Kho in 1985 declared Gua Lowo the largest and
                longest cave in Southeast Asia.</p>

              <p>Tapan Bathing Place is a natural pool located in Karangan Village, Karangan District, Trenggalek
                Regency.
                Surrounded by trees, it was once popular for its natural beauty and peaceful atmosphere.</p>
              <p>The pool is fed by a natural spring, offering visitors a cool swimming experience amid forest
                scenery.However, some reviews note that access roads and facilities have declined over time, and there
                are concerns that the site may no longer be open to the public.</p>
              <p><strong>History</strong><br>
                Originally, the Tapan bathing place, according to my ancestor Mbah Kemis, was a small spring (sendang)
                surrounded by stones arranged in a circular shape. In the past, the spring was used by people for ritual
                meditation, bathing, and other needs.

                Later, in the 1950s, the head of Karangan Village, Ngaidi, expanded it to about five meters while
                keeping its original physical shape. In 1994, Tapan was officially inaugurated as a tourist bathing site
                by the Governor of East Java, Basoefi Sudirman. Over time, the shape of the Tapan spring changed from
                circular to rectangular as it is seen today. Geographically, part of the Tapan area is located in
                Karangan Village, while another part is in Kerjo Village, Karangan District, Trenggalek Regency.
